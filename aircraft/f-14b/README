Realistic windtunnel based aerodynamic model of an F-14A and F-14B for FlightGear. See http://zaretto.com/f-14

Models an F14 with GE-110 or TF-30 engines. TF-30 engines have compressor stall simulated, GE-110 do not.

Low speed clean should be exactly as an F-14 

The aerodata used is from AFWAL-TR-80-3141, Part I and III. See http://zaretto.com/content/f-14-aerodynamic-data-sources
The windtunnel aerodyanmics are for sweep of 22degrees, positive alpha, clean, low speed 
so various data have been extrapolated estimated based on best  available data where 
I cannot find specific details for F14 other aero models that I can find (often using NASA
CR-1756 as guidance for general trends) are guidance or starting point for each value.

The estimation of negative alpha values follows CR-1756 trends with values based on F14 data for positive values.

Engine Thrust are based on NASA-TM-104326 tables 4-6 adjusted for altitude and with augmentation figures based on that of the mil thrust.

The flaps and auxiliary flaps coefficients are modelled based on tuning to meet F-14AAD-1 as no data
is currently available. The proportions assigned are relative to their surface area (as measured roughly 64% main, 36% aux) 
- the values assigned are 0.7 and 0.3 based on this and applies to ClDFM, CdDFM and CMDFM
